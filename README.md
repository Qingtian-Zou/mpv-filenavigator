# Mpv Filenavigator  
File navigator for mpv media player. Currently only works on linux, relies on standard output of test and pwd. Edit the settings variable in the lua file to change defaults and to add favorite paths.

#### Keybinds  
- __ctrl+f__ show directory. ctrl+i/j/k/l call the same function so this is not very nececcary to use/remember
- __ctrl+i/k__ cursor up/down
- __ctrl+j/l__ directory back/forward, incase of file append to playlist
- __ctrl+o__ open directory or file with mpv, same as `mpv /path/to/dir-or-file`, replaces playlist
- __ctrl+u__ cycle between favorite directories, edit settings to setup

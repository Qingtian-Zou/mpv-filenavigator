# Mpv Filenavigator  
File navigator for mpv media player. Currently only works on linux, relies on standard output of test and pwd. Might port it for windows later. 

#### Keybinds  
- __ctrl+f__ scan directory, if no file open defaults to /. ctrl+i/j/k/l call the same function so this is not very nececcary
- __ctrl+i/k__ cursor up/down
- __ctrl+j/l__ directory back/forward, incase of file play it.
- __ctrl+o__ open files in directory with mpv, same as mpv /path/to/dir
